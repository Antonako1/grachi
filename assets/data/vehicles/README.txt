If you want to create your own vehicles, see the \template\ folder
If you want to create your armaments, see the \template\ folder
If you want to add your own vehicle, see the corresponding template for missions
If you want to add your own armament, see the corresponding template for the vehicle

Do **NOT** change block, key or variable names that exist in the templates -
or ready made file! Otherwise the game will not work since it cannot load the data.


When importing a vehicle, it must be in its own corresponding folder
and you must tell the program what kind of vehicle it is. (see missions\readme.txt)
